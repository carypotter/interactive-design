  <div class="interview">

  <div class="question">
  You’ve called these works durational photographs, and your work is often placed in a conversation about photography. Do you come from a photography background? When did the motion become integrated into your practice? 
</div>

<div class="answer">
  I worked in the film industry before becoming an apprentice for an art photographer. This latter experience really helped me find a way into the art world from cinema.  I think that’s where I learned to resist cinematic language and terms, even though I admit I have always made cinema in the strictest sense.
</div>

  <div class="question">
  In an interview with Aperture you spoke about how these works are related to the evolution of technology in photography. Was having a practice related to newer media always of interest to you?
</div>

<div class="answer">
  That’s actually a hard question for me, initially I would probably deny any primary relationship to technology, but when I look at the history of my practice I am clearly drawn to the progression of image making through the development of tools that surround photography and filmmaking. I use the most current technology I can to make or exhibit the best picture possible. I guess to be more specific I see the computer and the screen as my tools, and because they are in such complete flux, my practice necessarily depends on their development. However, my concern for this development is every so slightly secondary to the production of pictures. 
</div>

<div class="question">
In this course we’ve been spending a lot of time looking at art practices that exist solely on the internet. While your work is screen based, the works are only seen on monitors at a certain size and scale, sometimes made from a specific material. Is it important to you that these works always have a physical presence, could you ever see them as existing only on computer screens? 
</div>

<div class="answer">
  I think in relation to my last answer, I do believe it is important for my pictures to have a physical presence, an incarnation. It is the traditional process of taking an image and making it flat and isolating it from its surrounding world that I am interested in, even though I am using the newest technology I can find to do so. 
</div>

<div class="question">
You’ve used the term “durational photographs” to describe many of these works, but some of the pieces in your current show seem to be moving into different territory. I’m specifically of thinking of Untitled (Sky) where the screen is split into three sections or how in many of the works there is a sequence of images played in a loop. Can you talk about this new direction? Do you feel the works are moving away from the idea of durational photography? 
</div>
    
<div class="answer">
  You’ve put your finger on it. In this work I was definitely trying to engage with the computer as the site of image generation; placing the lens further back in the process of production. I was trying to think about the studio as a computer and screen instead of a physical place. Thus many of the works are born on the computer, the sugar cubes for example are made out of still images, as is Untitled (ground). The sky piece is definitely an animated image, a way of making an impossible or architectural intervention with a classic trope subject in photography. 

And yes I don’t necessarily consider this body of work durational photography, I’m not totally sure what it is yet, but I can say that it’s more willing to engage with cinema or expanded cinema, narrative, and sculpture.
