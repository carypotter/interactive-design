		<h1>How to Make People Think You're Immortal</h1>
    	<div class="summary">
	    	As a human, you are most definitely mortal. Unfortunately, there is little you can do to change the fact that your body will some day grow old and die. However, that doesn't mean that you can't give the impression that your longevity is somewhat greater than that of your fellow mortals.
			<br>
			<br>
			With a bit of mystery, maturity, and reliance on the things that give an impression of a lengthy life, you may succeed in convincing the less skeptical around you that you are truly able to live forever and for everyone else, you can at least present the aura of being timeless. If you're interested in creating a romanticized Victorian-era style of immortality, read on!

		<h2>Steps</h2>

	<ol>

		<li><img src="images/01.jpg">
			Dress in old-fashioned clothing. The exact era does not matter, but the quality is very important. A subtle Victorian fashion is ideal for giving the impression that you've already been around for some time. You can find little pieces of Victorian style garb at thrift stores like Goodwill, or you could always buy online. Don't forget to use your creativity to vamp up clothing in the Victorian style – think lace, brooches, brocade, velvet, etc.
				<ul>

					<li>
					<img src="images/02.jpg">
					Look for vintage brooches, particularly cameos. They can go on sweaters, dresses, and more to give the impression of an earlier age.
					</li>

					<li>
					<img src="images/03.jpg">
					Sweaters and shawls are great, because they look old-fashioned and they match perfectly with vintage brooches.
					</li>

					<li>
					<img src="images/04.jpg">
					Wear older style dresses and frocks. 
					</li>

					<li>
					<img src="images/05.jpg">
					Don't forget your old-fashioned modesty! People of your time didn't wear super-tight tank tops or skimpy little cut-off shorts. Why, back in previous centuries, baring your ankles was unheard of. Of course, after living through different eras, you've probably modernized a bit, so it's no big deal to wear a skirt that reaches your knees rather than your ankles, or to wear a top that doesn't touch your collarbones; just remember to dress somewhat modestly.
					</li>
					
				</ul>
		</li>
			
		<li>
			<img src="images/06.jpg">
			Have a collection of "things that work" - You want your furniture to be serviceable and designed to last (You assume that you're going to outlive the lifetime guarantee on most things), whichever era it's from. Your clothes should be the best examples of their type, however old they are - If you bought a good suit in 1930, you could still be wearing it now, likewise your car, or your bureau. This ties into the idea of refined taste - What you knew you enjoyed ninety years ago is still something you can enjoy now, regardless of modern fashion.
		</li>

		<li>
            <img src="images/07.jpg">
			Learn old languages, like Ancient Greek or Ancient Egyptian, depending on the era you want to portray yourself as from. This will increase your authenticity of actually being from the time and place.
		</li>

		<li>
			<img src="images/08.jpg">
			Act like you have many secrets. If someone asks to come to your house later than 7 o'clock, always come up with a hasty but believable excuse; immortal people have many secrets that unravel after dark. Leave around some "accidental" clues so people will believe you are lying about where you are at night. Then, deny it half-believably, but not so well that they will actually believe you. Slight suspicion is the key.
		</li>

		<li>
            <img src="images/09.jpg">
			Seem to have been there. Brush up on your history or, at the very least, get a wistful look in your eye when somebody brings it up. Try working extra hard for a history test about the place and time you were born. If your teacher asks you something and you really don't know the answer, just say that you’d prefer not to talk about it. Or, if you think you know but make a mistake, act slightly confused when the teacher corrects you. (You might even throw in a line about how history is written by the victors.)
		</li>

	
		<li>
            <img src="images/10.jpg">
			Become familiar with classical music. Mozart, Tchaikovsky, Beethoven, Chopin, Bach... all the greats. It's impressive and unusual when a young person has an intimate familiarity with music from eras long before his or her own, so people will most likely pay quite a bit of notice to your extensive (and uncommon) interest.
		</li>

		<ul>
					<li>
						Couple this interest with clear and verifiable knowledge about the composers. Depending on how good you are at storytelling, you might even like to sprinkle your conversation with anecdotes about "the time that Mozart did X." Keep in mind that there’s a huge difference between dropping a "that one time Mozart…" and a "that one time 'Wolfgang and I…”
					</li>

					<li>
						Remember that things which were common knowledge in the past could be a salacious secret now, and vice-verse; If you knew that Oscar Wilde was gay before his arrest in 1895, that places you as being part of a very particular social group, and a privileged insider. You might find it jarring that this is now common knowledge.
					</li>
		</ul>
