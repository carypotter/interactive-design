					<p>
						A certain woman had a very sharp consciousness but <a href="http://carypotter.github.io/interactive-design/davis/stylesix_davis.html">almost no memory</a>. She remembered enough to get by from day to day. She remembered enough to work, and she worked hard. She did good work, and was paid for it, and earned enough to get by, but she did not remember her work, so that she could not answer questions about it when people asked, as they did ask, since the work she did was interesting.
